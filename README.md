### Hi, I'm Andreu :wave:

My interest on code development started when I was working as a researcher on the University of Barcelona, while doing my PhD on climate change and geology :earth_africa:. There I worked on numerical modelling :bar_chart:, Groovy scripting :star:, MySQL :ledger:, and I started some projects in Python :snake:.

After the completion of my PhD, I enrolled the IT-Academy (Barcelona) to learn Java :coffee: with the framework Spring 	:leaves:, MySQL and MongoDB :ledger:, and the typical server architectures (MVC, Repository pattern, SOLID...).

On my free time you will find me on the climbing wall :climbing:, kayaking :rowboat: or playing flamenco on my guitar :dancer:.
